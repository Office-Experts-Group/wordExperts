            Copilot, ChatGPT for Word and Claude for Word are improving every
            month. Microsoft alone has shipped model switching, agentic editing
            and tracked-change support in 2026. But in real business documents,
            the gap between the demo and the day-to-day is still wide. These are
            the complaints we hear most from Australian organisations.
