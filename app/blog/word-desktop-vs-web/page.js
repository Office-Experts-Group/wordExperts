          <h2>Free vs Paid? The Question Every Business Asks</h2>
          <p>
            Microsoft offers Word for "free" through the web. But is it really
            enough for professional work? Understanding what you lose helps you
            decide. For personal use, the free version will often suffice; small
            businesses can also get away without the subscription fee. But often
            there is a tipping point where users find themselves needing more
            features, or suffering through
            <Link href={"/remove-repetition-and-increase-productivity"}>
              {" "}
              tireless repetitive tasks
            </Link>
            .
          </p>
          <p>
            Can you skip the subscription? What do you actually get for paying?
            When is free Word sufficient?
          </p>

          <h2>What Is "Word for Web"?</h2>
          <p>
            Word for Web is Microsoft's browser-based version of Word. It's free
            with a Microsoft account, works on any device with internet, and
            stores files in OneDrive (free 5GB). Real-time collaboration is
            built-in, making it accessible for simple document collaboration
            needs.

          <h2>Desktop Collaboration: The Professional Standard</h2>
          <p>
            For professional teams working on complex documents, Desktop Word
            opened from SharePoint or OneDrive provides the most stable and
            feature-rich collaboration environment. This approach combines the
            full power of Desktop Word with real-time co-authoring capabilities.
          </p>

          <h3>Why Desktop Collaboration is Preferred</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Stability:</strong> Desktop provides a more stable
              environment for complex documents with extensive formatting, large
              file sizes, or numerous collaborators.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Full Features While Collaborating:</strong> Access all
              advanced features (track changes, compare documents, macros, mail

              <strong>Reality -</strong> It's a permanent, free product, just
              with fewer features.

            {/* REVISION: Completely rewrote Myth 2 to support Desktop collaboration */}
            <h3>Myth 2: "I must use the web version for collaboration"</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Reality -</strong> Desktop Word provides superior
              collaboration when files are opened from SharePoint or OneDrive.
            </p>

            <h3>Myth 3: "Subscription means I don't own my software"</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Reality -</strong> You own your documents; subscription is
              for app access and services.
            </p>

            <h3>Myth 4: "One-time purchase is always cheaper"</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Reality -</strong> Over 3+ years, subscription often
              better value (includes storage + updates)
            </p>

            <h3>Myth 5: "Web version requires constant internet"</h3>

          <h3>Final Recommendation</h3>
          <p>
            For Australian businesses and professionals, Microsoft 365
            subscription (Business Standard for teams) offers the best balance
            of features, flexibility, and value. This provides Desktop Word for
            professional collaboration via SharePoint/OneDrive, whilst
            maintaining web access as a convenient backup. Students and casual
            users can often thrive on the free web version for simple documents.
            Test your actual workflow before purchasing to avoid paying for
            features you don't need.
