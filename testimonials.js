He was open to suggestions and seeking further assistance to resolve the issue and his communication was prompt, professional and sometimes very entertaining which was greatly appreciated when our software stopped working and my stress levels were going through the roof! I would 100% work with James again - in fact, he is now our company point of contact for support with our inhouse management program which was designed by a company who no longer supports the program and left us quite vulnerable should the system stop working. James took the time to learn our program so he could assist us with any future developments and updates which is critical to reducing our business IT risk. I can't rate James highly enough and I'm so glad to have found Office Experts!",

Primarily the software was designed to enable our property inspectors to collect onsite data and upload to a back-end database from the field, therefore removing the need to go back to the office to manually upload the data. The secondary phase of our IT development was to create a program that could analyse and process the uploaded data with minimal input, a feat successfully achieved by Office Experts. From our experience the staff at Office Experts have often gone beyond expectations. Their commitment to the project and their drive to deliver the end product is achieved through professionalism, experience and a solid work ethic.",

      "We have found Office Experts a fantastic partner to develop new projects that improve our internal processes using simple Office tools that most average IT users can handle themselves but aren't able to tailor to their own day-to-day requirements. Office Experts' consultant Linda Campbell was great from the start of the tendering process to conception and handover of the finished program. As a professional, she was able not only to understand very quickly our needs but also flexible and dynamic enough to implement and complete all the necessary tasks to efficiently deliver the required results. Linda has a wide understanding of the B2B operational key areas and thanks to her outstanding communication skills she has provided an extremely valuable feedback to produce a system that will serve our purposes in the years to come. We are looking forward to working with Office Experts and Linda in future projects. We would strongly recommend Office Experts services to any other company or individual that requires a solution for their operational issues but can't find the time, skills or inspiration to develop a tailored system that suits their needs. Definitely, a wonderful external partner for any business!",

Right from the 'get go' Jason was not only communicable but made time to understand my deliverables and took ownership of the task. As well as electronic correspondence Jason opened a verbal dialogue which was very important to me as we were able to fully understand the 'build' and 'pathway' to improvements he introduced into the project. Jason listened and went 'above & beyond' by introducing 'smarts' into the project that I didn't think of from the outset. At the end I got more than expected in a timely manner and an effective program; and all within our budget. If I was to rank my experience by stars - I would definitely allot ALL 5 Stars and have no hesitation in recommending Office Experts to anyone looking for a software solution.",
